“New and Trending” – this buzz word has become the part of our day to day life. Store openings at a burning discounts, is dated now. Users tend to get almost a reasonable discount on every store they visit – nearby or far. Hence, a cumbersome amount of work is going on in the direction to give users the best optimal or nearest store to fulfill their needs. But in today’s trend, owing to the busyness of people’s life, specific needs must be met, making the search more optimized and precise. This evolves a new concept – “Product Searching”. In this app – BringMe, we present a novel approach for searching a specific product nearest to the user. A user has to just enter the product title or if the needs are specific, then product detail like brand name, contents etc. needs to be given as input. The nearest store selling the product will be showcased. The main motive behind this application is an optimized search of user needs, specific to the product and not the entire store.
